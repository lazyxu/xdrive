# FileExplorer design

This document is the canonical **non-performance** FileExplorer design contract for Web and Desktop. Performance-specific constraints and benchmarks live in `docs/file-explorer-performance.md`.

## Shared architecture

- Web and Desktop use the shared FileExplorer interaction/model layer and shared MUI surface under `ui/shared`.
- Platform-specific transport remains local: Web REST/fetch stays in Web; Desktop Electron/Agent IPC and native-shell integration stay in Desktop.
- Server is authoritative for filesystem semantics that require the full namespace. Clients must not reconstruct recursive filesystem state by paginating/traversing the tree in the renderer.
- New FileExplorer features should preserve Web/Desktop behavior parity unless the feature is inherently platform-specific.

## Folder Properties

Folder Properties must report real recursive statistics rather than displaying `—` for directories.

### Statistics contract

The Server computes statistics from the selected node snapshot and returns enough data for both a single folder and mixed multi-selection:

- total byte size of all counted files;
- recursive file count;
- recursive folder count;
- selected/top-level item count as needed for presentation;
- no double counting when a selected node is already contained by another selected folder.

The Server must:

- authorize every selected node against the signed-in owner;
- operate only on active nodes unless the calling surface is explicitly a Trash surface;
- reduce overlapping selections to effective top-level roots before recursive aggregation;
- use a recursive database query/CTE (or an equivalent Server-side set operation);
- never require Web/Desktop to load every descendant;
- keep recursive statistics out of normal directory-list payloads so opening/listing a directory remains cheap.

For a single file, existing direct metadata may be rendered immediately. If recursive/mixed statistics are requested, the dialog may show `正在计算…` until the Server result arrives.

### Request-scoped automatic cancellation

Folder Properties statistics are **request-scoped**, not a durable background job. They do not create a Task Center row.

Cancellation is automatic:

1. opening Properties starts a request for the current immutable selection snapshot;
2. closing the dialog aborts the request;
3. opening/replacing Properties for a different selection aborts the previous request before starting the next;
4. unmounting FileExplorer aborts any outstanding Properties request;
5. a late completion from an older request is ignored even if transport cancellation races with completion.

There is no separate user-visible Cancel button for this operation; closing the dialog is the cancellation action.

Transport requirements:

- **Web:** pass an `AbortSignal` through the API request to `fetch`;
- **Desktop:** use a request identifier/cancellation path that propagates renderer cancellation through Electron main and xdrive-agent to the Go client request context;
- **Server:** the handler and recursive database query use the HTTP request context so client cancellation interrupts database work.

An intentional abort is not a failure and must not produce an error toast.

## Async scope rule

Do not use Folder Properties work as a reason to retrofit cancellation across unrelated async subsystems. Transfers, thumbnails, analysis previews, media indexing, Photo Intelligence, archive preparation, and maintenance are reviewed for cancellation when their own subsystem is being changed or when a specific correctness issue requires it.

Existing cancellation/control behavior already implemented for those subsystems remains in place.

## Tests

Folder Properties coverage must include:

- recursive size and file/folder counts;
- nested-folder aggregation;
- mixed file/folder multi-selection;
- ancestor/descendant selection without double counting;
- owner isolation and stale/missing nodes;
- Web automatic abort when Properties closes or is replaced;
- Desktop automatic abort propagation through IPC/Agent;
- Server request-context cancellation;
- stale completion cannot overwrite a newer Properties request;
- intentional abort does not surface as an error.
